What this code does:

This is a cloud word generated by text responses on a certain question.

Important stuff:

QuestionPro runs the v 5.0.14 of Highcharts, if we load a module in a different version it wont work.

Required modules:

<script src="https://code.highcharts.com/highcharts.js"></script>
